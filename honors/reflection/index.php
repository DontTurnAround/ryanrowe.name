        <p>I cannot say who I am, however, I can say who I was. When I was in high school, I was a good student. I read the assigned readings, memorized the assigned facts, and once I wrote them on a test, I discarded them to prepare for the relentless influx of new non-contextualized and fragmented morsels of information. I came to college, to the University of Washington, because I sought an end to the torrent of indifference and monotony. I chose to apply to the honors department because I did not want to simply take classes within a narrow scope, germane to my interests, while continuing to squirrel away facts for the future like acorns for the winter. I wanted to see the interconnectedness of what I learn, the gleaming web connecting physics, art, psychology, and philosophy, and every other discipline. It can only be found with a bright enough light, but once it presents itself, everything makes sense.</p>

		<p>My past self is a mere acquaintance with whom I share fond memories but will never interact again. The haze of time distorts the view of our past selves, and though I remember what he has done, he will never know what I will do. For as bad as humans are at recollecting the past, we are worse at predicting the future. The shriveled husk of myself that was left behind as a snake leaves behind its skin does not know the experiences I have endured. He does not know the feeling of true love and the accompanying desolation. He does not know leaving everyone behind to move across the country. He does not know the feeling of staying awake with his mother and watching her die. As much as I wish now that he could have known these things so that my past actions could be altered, he will not. Only when the events of my life fade into the obscuring and disfiguring fog of time will he know, and by that time I will no longer be who am I today. I will be a new person, and what I was before will become a part of the shadow that is persistently trailing my present self.</p>

		<p>I cannot say who my future self will be. I can never hope to know him, but he will know me. His formation is determined by the actions I take today and I hope that he will look back fondly and thank me for what I have done, although I am sure there will be things I will want to have done differently but that is a consequence of the inevitability of time. Here I hope I will provide my future self with the tools, knowledge, and experiences I need for the rest of my life. I hope to expand upon my love of learning and to learn how to continue to sate my appetite beyond college. I wish to develop and mature, to grow to see beyond the superficial facade of reality and into itâ€™s inner workings and truths.</p>

		<p>I would like to guide myself to be a better person in the future than I am now which is an arduous feat to accomplish. When we project ourselves into the future, we see ourselves as we are now. We seldom think of the actions we take today as changing who we will be, when in fact, it is nearly impossible to take actions that are not. If my past self is two dimensional and immutable and my current self is three dimensional and changing, then my future self is four dimensional, in constant flux and superposition; he is impossible to fully comprehend and predict. All I can hope is that one day, when all of the future possibilities collapse into the certainty of the present, that I am happy with the outcome.</p>
