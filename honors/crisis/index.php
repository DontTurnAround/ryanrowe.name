        <p>With the worsening of the conflict in Syria, millions of Syrians are emmigrating to nearby countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe in an effort to escape the violence in their own country. In addition, millions are leaving Iraq in response to the rise of ISIS. The culmination of this exodus is a massive and problematic migrant crisis, the largest since World War II, across Europe. Despite their dire circumstances, not every country is welcoming the &ldquo;swarm of people,&rdquo; as the prime minister of the United Kingdom so colorfully put it<sup><a href="#1" title="&ldquo;Calais crisis: Cameron condemned for &ldsuo;dehumanising&rsquo; description of migrants,&rdquo; The Guardian">1</a></sup>. In a recent sensationalized video clip, while a large group fled from a refugee holding camp, a Hungarian reporter purposely kicked and tripped a refugee—a father—carrying a child. Although she was censured and fired for her actions, her attitude typifies that of many European countries towards the millions of displaced people looking for a new home. From the Hungarian Prime Minister telling these émigrés: &ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; to Danish ads attempting to deter immigrants from seeking asylum in Denmark<sup><a href="#2" title="&ldquo;&lsquo;People in Europe are full of fear&rsquo; over refugee influx,&rdquo; The Washington Post">2</a></sup>, there is a general sense of hostility towards these people who want nothing more than to find a new place to live their lives in peace.</p>

		<p>Surprisingly, one of the few countries receiving these people with open arms is Germany. There are even stories of Germans waiting at train stations to welcome and applaud incoming refugees. The world could learn a valuable lesson from Germany and the incredible compassion they have demonstrated. As the influx has increased, the Germany&rsquo;s exuberance seems to have somewhat faded as it would for any country inundated by hundreds of thousands of lost souls. Working together, the powers of Europe could help millions and mitigate the refugee crisis by distributing the burden amongst all countries instead of battening down the hatches and hoping other countries will handle the situation.</p>

		<p>These countries need to think at several different levels simultaneously. In addition to the humanitarian aspect of helping those in need, accepting large numbers of refugees, in almost all cases, leads to economic improvement in the countries that accept them because they contribute more than they receive<sup><a href="#3" title="&ldquo;Much ado about nothing? The economic impact of refugee &lsquo;invasions&rsquo;,&rdquo; Brookings Institution">3</a></sup>. Accepting refugees also helps combat the low fertility rate and aging populace plaguing most developed countries. </p>

		<p>By demonstrating compassion and working tandem, European countries could help their own citizens and the millions of people escaping their war-torn homelands. Together they could globally improve quality of life and promote true change in today&rsquo;s feckless political climate of xenophobia and eschewal of responsibility. This could very easily become a reality if world leaders began thinking in three dimensions instead of the narrowminded one dimension they usually do. They would need to recognize the local, global, societal, and economic ramifications of the refugee crisis and the impact they could have as part of the solution in order to work together to be the solution.</p>
